#======================= Global Settings =======================

[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

   # Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP

   # server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)

#### Networking ####

   # The specific set of interfaces / networks to bind to
   # This can be either the interface name or an IP address/netmask;
   # interface names are normally preferred
   interfaces = lo enp2s0

   # Only bind to the named interfaces and/or networks; you must use the
   # 'interfaces' option above to use this.
   # It is recommended that you enable this feature if your Samba machine is
   # not protected by a firewall or is a firewall itself.  However, this
   # option cannot handle dynamic or non-broadcast interfaces correctly.
   bind interfaces only = yes

#### Debugging/Accounting ####

   # This tells Samba to use a separate log file for each machine
   # that connects
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

   # Cap the size of the individual log files (in KiB).
   max log size = 1000

   # We want Samba to only log to /var/log/samba/log.{smbd,nmbd}.
   # Append syslog@1 if you want important messages to be sent to syslog too.
   logging = file

   # Do something sensible when Samba crashes: mail the admin a backtrace
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

####### Authentication #######

   # Server role. Defines in which mode Samba will operate. Possible
   # values are "standalone server", "member server", "classic primary
   # domain controller", "classic backup domain controller", "active
   # directory domain controller". 
   #
   # Most people will want "standalone server" or "member server".
   # Running as "active directory domain controller" will require first
   # running "samba-tool domain provision" to wipe databases and create a
   # new domain.
   server role = standalone server

   obey pam restrictions = yes

   # This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to sync the Unix
   # password with the SMB password when the encrypted SMB password in the
   # passdb is changed.
   unix password sync = yes

   # For Unix password sync to work on a Debian GNU/Linux system, the following
   # parameters must be set (thanks to Ian Kahan <<kahan@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> for
   # sending the correct chat script for the passwd program in Debian Sarge).
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   # This boolean controls whether PAM will be used for password changes
   # when requested by an SMB client instead of the program listed in
   # 'passwd program'. The default is 'no'.
   pam password change = yes

   # This option controls how unsuccessful authentication attempts are mapped
   # to anonymous connections
   map to guest = bad user

########## Domains ###########

# Allow users who've been granted usershare privileges to create
# public shares, not just authenticated ones
   usershare allow guests = yes
